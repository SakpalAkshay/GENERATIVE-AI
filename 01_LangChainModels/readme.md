# LangChain Model Component

## One-line Summary
The content teaches how LangChain’s Model component standardizes access to language and embedding models (closed and open source), and walks through hands‑on code for LLMs vs Chat Models, provider swaps (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini), embeddings (OpenAI, Hugging Face), key parameters (temperature, max tokens), and a document similarity mini‑app using cosine similarity.

---

## What the Model Component Is
- LangChain’s Model component provides a common interface to connect with different AI models, mainly Language Models and Embedding Models.
- **Language Models** take text and return text; **Embedding Models** take text and return number vectors used for semantic search and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).

---

## Language Models: LLMs vs Chat Models

### LLMs
- LLMs are general‑purpose: input a string, output a string; historically common but being deprecated in favor of Chat Models in newer LangChain versions.

### Chat Models
- Chat Models are optimized for multi‑turn conversation; they accept a sequence of messages, support roles (system/user/assistant), conversation history, and return structured message objects with metadata.

---

## When to Use Which
- **LLMs**: Use for deterministic text generation, summarization, translation, or code generation when a simple string‑in, string‑out flow suffices.
- **Chat Models**: Use for chatbots, assistants, agents, customer support bots, AI tutors, and any multi‑turn dialogues with role awareness and memory.

---

## Providers Covered (Closed Source)

### OpenAI
- GPT models via LangChain’s OpenAI (LLM) and ChatOpenAI (Chat Model) classes; requires a paid API key set in an `.env` file.

### Anthropic
- Claude 3.5 series via ChatAnthropic; similar setup with paid API key, consistent invocation via `model.invoke(...)`.

### Google
- Gemini 1.5 Pro via ChatGoogleGenerativeAI; obtain API key, configure env var, and call `model.invoke(...)`.

---

## Open Source Models: Why and Where

### Pros of Open Source
- No per‑token API fees when run locally.
- Full control and customization.
- Better data privacy (data stays on local/server).
- Flexible deployment.

### Popular Models
- Llama, Mistral, Falcon, Qwen, and domain‑specific models like BLOOM; all browsable and downloadable from Hugging Face.

---

## Key LangChain Interfaces and Patterns
- Consistent `invoke` method across core components (models, prompts, chains), simplifying provider swaps with minimal code changes.
- Class inheritance: LLMs inherit `BaseLLM`; Chat Models inherit `BaseChatModel`, yielding different input/output forms.

---

## Crucial Parameters

- **Temperature**: Controls randomness/creativity.
  - Lower (0–0.3) for deterministic/precise tasks (math, code).
  - Mid (0.5–0.7) for general explanations.
  - Higher (0.9–1.2+) for story/jokes/brainstorming.
  
- **Max Completion Tokens**: Caps output length for cost and brevity control; helpful because providers bill per token.

---

## Environment and Setup Workflow
- Create a project folder, initialize a virtual environment, install requirements via `requirements.txt`, verify LangChain version, and organize source by LLMs, Chat Models, and Embedding Models folders.
- Store provider API keys in `.env` with specific variable names expected by integrations (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`).



# Code Examples and Provider Swaps

## Coding Patterns: LLM vs Chat Model

### LLM (OpenAI Instruct example)
```python
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

model = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
result = model.invoke("What is the capital of India?")
print(result.content)


from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.2, max_tokens=150)
result = model.invoke("Tell me about Paris.")
print(result.content)

# Practical Tips and Gotchas

## Tips:
1. **Always Load .env Early**: 
   - Ensure you call `load_dotenv()` early in your code so provider SDKs can find keys automatically.

2. **Tokenization vs Words**:
   - Tokens are not exactly words. Treat them as approximate units for budgeting and mental models.
  
3. **Temperature Tuning**:
   - Keep near zero for repeatable outputs in production pipelines.
   - Increase only for creative tasks like story writing, jokes, etc.

4. **Costs**:
   - Embedding costs per million tokens are low.
   - Model generation is pricier, so control max tokens and consider summarization to reduce costs.

## Quick “How‑To” Checklists

### Run an OpenAI Chat Model
```bash
# Install langchain and provider integration
pip install langchain openai

# Put OPENAI_API_KEY in .env and call load_dotenv()
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Example code
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.2)
result = model.invoke("What is the capital of India?")
print(result.content)
