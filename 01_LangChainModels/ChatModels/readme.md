# Chat Models

Chat Models are optimized for multi‑turn conversation; they accept a sequence of messages, support roles (system/user/assistant), conversation history, and return structured message objects with metadata.

Use Chat Models for chatbots, assistants, agents, customer support bots, AI tutors, and any multi‑turn dialogues with role awareness and memory.
